# Wealth-Projection-Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation for wealth projection simulations

following my recent test on a monte carlo simulation project, I will find what I pull from memory, and create a simulaiton on the side.

initial goal:
1. single account, with cash in/out flows, turnover, liquidations if needed, simplified treatment of cash flow, income, unrealized gain, realized gains (carryforward will be just zone)
1.1 initial setup: short term capital gain tax rate, long term capital gain tax rate, dividend tax rate
1.2 year-to-year change external setup: cash flow needs, total return rate, dividend yield, 
1.3 account BOY info: Total Wealth, 
2. multiple accounts, liquidation set as same fraction for all accounts if liquidation is needed, now carryover
