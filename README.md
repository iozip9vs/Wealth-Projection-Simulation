# Wealth-Projection-Simulation
Monte Carlo simulation for wealth projection simulations

# initial goal:

1. single account, with cash in/out flows, turnover, liquidations if needed, simplified treatment of cash flow, income, unrealized gain, realized gains (carryforward will be just zone)

  1.1 initial setup: short term capital gain tax rate, long term capital gain tax rate, dividend tax rate

  1.2 year-to-year change external setup: cash flow needs, total return rate, dividend yield, 

  1.3 account BOY info: Total Wealth, Unrealized Capital Gain, New Investment Fraction (NIF), Capital Loss Carry Forward
  
  1.4 

# stage 2 goal:
2. multiple accounts, liquidation set as same fraction for all accounts if liquidation is needed, now carryover

# stage 3 goal:
